# Restaurant-Page

**Objective**

I created a four page restaurant website using JavaScript, HTML, JSON, Webpack, and CSS. The webpage is for a fictional restaurant and has a Home, Menu, Contact, and Sign-Up page. All form validation is done using JavaScript.

***Features***
1. Home Page:
   
   a. The Home page features the bakery name with background image, two paragraphs of text about the resturant, the hours and location of the bakery.
   
2. Menu Page:
   
   a. I used a function to create the menu cards instead of creating the cards one by one.
   
3. Contact Page:
   
   a. The Contact Page features two fictional bakers and contact information for the store.

4. Sign-Up Page:

   a. The sign-up page features a form that has the inputs name, email, phone, zip code, password, and confirm password.

   b. Each field will error as the user goes through the form if the form field is skipped.

   c. The confirm password will error if the password and confirm password do not match.

   d. When pushed, the sign-up button will alert the user if their form was submitted successfully (no inputs missing and passwords match) or if they need to make corrections.
   
5. The tabs at the top work of a function that clears each page and then shows the new content.
